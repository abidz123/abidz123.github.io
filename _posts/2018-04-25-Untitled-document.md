Blog 7

Today we did code academy and I really enjoyed it because it was quite difficult and it challenged me a lot . I really persevered and pushed through with my learning . however on a few occasions I did give up and ask for help even though I could have done it really easily . I learned python and I learned about *print* an lots of other variables . I did well because I got up to Ex 1 8 during the lesson and for my homework I pushed through and did 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes . I am proud of myself because I did not expect myself to do this well on my first attempt .
