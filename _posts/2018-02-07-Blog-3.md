**LESSON 3**

**Today we had a cover teacher , Mr Sharp . I was a bit disappointed because I really enjoy it when Mr Cullen is teaching us because he is more knowledgeable in the field and Mr Sharp could not answer most of our questions . However I felt that this lesson was a huge improvement to last lesson because last lesson I did not do the work as efficiently as I thought I would . But this lesson I was very proud of how we did our work very quickly and helped each other through the struggles , like making a character that moved . We struggled at first but as we combined our knowledge we started to figure out how to do it and I was very pleased with the results and I'm even more pleased with our efficiency in the lesson .**
