**Lesson 2**

**Today we carried on doing fuse box and we progressed in our booklet thing . We as a group have become very good at fuse box and I think we achieved the maximum we could possibly do . The only thing I deeply regret is that we took quite a long time to figure the new chapter out and we didn't do as a efficiently as last time . However we as a group did complete the task that was set and we did a good job . Next time we can hopefully do things a lot quicker and help each other to do the work efficiently and good . Overall I believe we did an excellent job at fuse box and that we completed all the criteria we had a minor setback but hopefully next time that will not happen to us .**
