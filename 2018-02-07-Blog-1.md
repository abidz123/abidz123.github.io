**LESSON 1**

**Today we got into the lesson and met our teacher , his name is Mr Cullen . We started talking about program softwares and then we had to go and get a fuse box . Fuse box is a program which allows you to code things like words , sentences and pictures . We used the manual book to help us do the programming . We set up the fuse box and started . Me , Jude and Piers were very efficient in writing  "hello world" in fuse box . We could change the colours of the words and the background . I'm very proud of myself and my team because I did not expect to get it that easily on the first lesson . What I couldâ€™ve done better was to improve the efficiency in how we set up the fuse box . Overall I think that I did a very good job in completing the task and working as a team .**
